For correct operation, shared memory support has to be enabled
in Chromium by performing the following command as root :

sysctl kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

To preserve this setting across reboots, append the following
to /etc/sysctl.conf :

kern.ipc.shm_allow_removed=1

FreeBSD 11.0-R and newer have this set by default.

Chromium has a known problem of hanging tabs. The workaround
for this problem is to mount ~/.cache/chromium as tmpfs. In order
to do this, please create this directory if you don't have it as
user {user}:

$ mkdir ~{user}/.cache/chromium

and mount it as tmpfs, as root:

# echo "tmpfs /home/{user}/.cache/chromium tmpfs rw,late,size=300M 0 0" >> /etc/fstab
# mount /home/{user}/.cache/chromium
